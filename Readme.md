## Usage of GitHub Copilot ðŸ¤–

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code generation and completion tool that assists developers in writing code more efficiently. In the development of Personal Finance Tracker, GitHub Copilot can be used in various scenarios:

1. *Code generation*: GitHub Copilot can generate code snippets or even entire functions based on the context and requirements. It can help with tasks like creating event handlers, form validation, or manipulating the DOM.

2. *Code completion*: When writing code, GitHub Copilot can provide suggestions for completing statements, filling in function arguments, or offering alternative implementations. It can save time and reduce the likelihood of syntax errors.

3. *Documentation assistance*: GitHub Copilot can assist in writing code comments and documentation by generating descriptions or explanations for functions, classes, or variables. This helps improve code readability and maintainability.

4. *Pattern recognition*: GitHub Copilot can recognize common patterns or idioms in code and suggest appropriate solutions. It can assist in implementing best practices and following established design patterns.

5. *Error handling*: GitHub Copilot can provide guidance on handling errors or exceptions by suggesting error handling code or recommending specific error-checking techniques.

GitHub Copilot enhances the development process by accelerating code writing, reducing boilerplate code, and providing helpful suggestions for developers.
